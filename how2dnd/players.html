            <h1>How to Play D&D</h1>
            <p>Playing Dungeons and Dragons can be a fulfilling experience. The problem, however, is that learning how to play it isn't very easy. So, we've made a guide to help you learn the basics of playing D&D, from creating the characters to interacting with your DM's world and the players around the table.</p>

            <p>
                To the left, you'll find the basic D&amp;D character sheet. On this sheet, you'll record everything, from your character's name to the gear they have. Now, let's move to each part of the sheet.<br>
                Let's start with the bar on the top of the character sheet. The main things we'll focus on here are the class, race, and background.<br>
                A character's class is what gives them their powers; for example, while a fighter has honed their expertise in using weapons to fight, a wizard takes a different approach with spellcasting. Each class has different subclasses, which let you have a specific area of expertise in the niche that each class fits (For example, while a champion fighter may focus on honing their physical power, an Eldritch Knight Fighter learns how to use magic alongside their sword and shield). Note that if you choose a spellcasting class, there is a second character sheet to store your spells on.<br>
                In D&amp;D, race and species are the same thing. Some examples of races you could play as are elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, and even half&hyphen;orcs. Each race gives different bonuses to your character, and some even give special features.<br>
                There are plenty of backgrounds to pick from, such as Merchant, Entertainer, Gladiator, Outcast, Noble, and many more! Your background signifies what your character did before they started the adventure, and can give your character unique bonuses, like the Sage's knowledge or the Noble's status. <br>
                Any abilites that you gain from these three can be put in the Features and Traits box on the bottom right of the character sheet.<br>
                If you want an extensive list of all of the backgrounds, classes and races, go to <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&DBeyond</a> for a free way to look at possible options or even make your character online.<br>
                Next, let's move to the left side of the character sheet for stats and skills. During character creation, you get to roll for each of the six stats; Strength affecting how well you can use most weapons, Dexterity making you harder to hit, stealthier, and faster to react, Constitution giving you more health and helping against poisons, Intelligence helping your character recall important information, Wisdom aiding you in tasks that require experience, and Charisma giving you more of an affect on other people's emotions (be it for better or worse).<br>
                To roll for stats, you roll four six-sided dice (4d6), remove the one with the smallest number, and add up the other three. Repeat that five more times, and decide which of the numbers go in each stat. Keep in mind that each class has different stats that are important to them (Classes like Fighter and Rogue have more importance with Strength and Dexterity, while spellcasters like Wizard, Sorcerer and Warlock focus more on Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma). After you've rolled those stats, you have to figure out the modifier for that stat. If the number is below 10, add 2 until it's 10 or 11, and subtract 1 to the modifier score until you're done. If the number is 10 or 11, your modifier is 0. If your number is above 12, subtract 2 and add 1 to the modifier until you're at 10 or 11. So, for an 18 in a stat, you'd get a +4 to your modifier, and for a 3, you'd get a -4. Each of these stats also has a saving throw box, and your class will give you proficiency on specific saving throws.<br>
                We're now moving on to skills: If you look at the boxes to the right of the stats, you'll see that each skill has a different stat it uses, surrounded by parentheses. If you want to use a skill, you roll a 20-sided dice (also called a D20), and you add the modifier of the stat it's using to the roll. Your race, class and background can give you proficiency with these skills, which gives you an extra bonus to the roll depending on the level of your character. You can also get proficiency with other things from your class or race, like gaining proficiency with a longbow from being a wood elf, or gaining proficiency with heavy armor like plate armor as a Fighter.<br>
                Looking at the box in the middle of the character sheet, you'll see the armor class, initiative, speed, hit points, and hit dice (We'll cover death saves later).<br>
                Your Armor Class determines how hard it is for enemies to hit you, and to get it you add 10 to your Dexterity modifier. Some races and classes have features that change how it's calculated, so be on the lookout for that.<br>
                Initiative is rolled at the start of any combat, and is calculated the same way as armor class, and extra modifiers can be added through certain class features or feats.<br>
                Your speed depends on your race, and some classes can add to it. The base speed for most races is 30 feet.<br>
                Your hit points are based off of your class; each class is given a different dice to roll, with the least being d4s for Wizards, and the highest being d12s for Barbarians. For the first level, you take the highest number on the dice you were given, and add your Constitution modifier, and for each level after, you roll the dice and add the Constitution modifier.<br>
                Your hit dice is an amount of your classes dice equal to your level (so for a Wizard, you would have 3d4 hit dice at level 3).<br>
                Now, we'll move away from the character sheet for a moment and talk about creating the character itself. Dungeons and Dragons is a game where you tell a story with your character, so you need to have a unique character. To achieve this, you can give your character a backstory. By making a backstory, you've given your Dungeon Master a way that they can incorporate your character into the world, and it can be as simple as them being a travelling merchant, or can even be a short story about how your character managed to outsmart a dragon; the only limit to your backstory is your creativity. Your character's background gives you a list of personality traits, ideals, bonds and flaws (stored on the right side of the character sheet) that you can take from when you're deciding what your character will be like, but keep in mind that these are optional, and you can make your own for any of these if you want to.<br>
                Finally, you can give your character some gear! Each class and background gives you starting equipment (and sometimes even some spare gold) that you can choose from when creating your character. Anything that you take is stored in the Equipment box at the bottom of the character sheet.

                Now that you have a character, you have to learn how to use it in the game. By looking at the descriptions of your gear, you find out what modifiers you need, or what you need to change in your character sheet. For example, armor changes how you calculate your armor class, and most weapons use your strength modifier.<br>
                Regarding combat, there are a few crucial details you have to know: At the start of each combat, you roll initiative. The highest number rolled goes first, and the lowest last. Your armor class will be used when you're attacked by someone directly, and you'll use saving throws against Area of Effect attacks, like a fireball. Your DM will tell you what you need to do when you try something.

            <p>
                Whenever you aren't in combat, you'll need to know how to interact with the world the DM has made. Each skill you have can be used to do anything from pickpocketing a rich merchant to intimidating a dragon (Disclaimer: We do not take responsibility for any characters killed in attempts to intimidate dragons). If you want to do something, say it out loud and the DM will tell you what you need to do.

                One of the best parts of D&D is being able to interact with those around the table, but keep in mind that not everyone has the same ideas of fun. Don't try and force others at the table to do something, but you can always make a suggestion for something in-character!
