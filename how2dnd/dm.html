                    So you're looking to take a step further than playing the game and run a campaign? Well look no further, as this page has all the info you need. From worldbuilding to working with your players, you can learn it here. Keep in mind that one of the most important parts of running a game is knowing how to play, so if you don't know anything about the game, DMing will be much more difficult. You are the enforcer of rules, after all.

                    One of the main parts of being a DM is finding, or making, a world for the campaign to run on. If you find a world, you should get all of the important information about that world into your head before you run the campaign.<br>
                    If you're planning on making a world, there are a lot of steps. In the Dungeon Masters' Guide, a book that is crucial to read if you want to run a game, it has a list of some of the steps to making a world:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep Core Assumptions: There are things about D&D that are implied when making a world, such as the world being magical, or full of past conflicts.</li>
                        <li>Making the world your own: Taking a step to make a world for your campaign means that you can change some of the core assumptions of that world. For example, you could have magic be a rare resource in that world, with barely anyone having access to it.</li>
                        <li>Gods of the World: One of the assumptions of D&D worlds is that there are higher beings, or deities, pulling the strings. When making a world, decide what Gods there are, if any, and how they interact with your world. They might interact with the world themselves, or they might be beings of myths and legends, like in real life.</li>
                        <li>Make a map: Even if you don't make a physical map of the world, you should at least have a mental image of what the world looks like. How many continents are there? How many countries? What's the distance between each town? Ask yourself questions like these when making your world.</li>
                        <li>Create a Multiverse: This one is best explained by the Dungeon Master's Guide, but the basics of it are that adventures can span across multiple dimensions. For example, your party could travel from your regular world to the Feywilds, a land full of mystical creatures and magical biomes.</a>.</li>

                <h1>Adding to Your World</h1>
                <p>
                    Now that you have a world, you need to add things to it! To name a few important things, you need to fill the world with unique NPCs, or Non-Player Characters. These NPCs will interact with the characters, with some selling items or services, and some just striking up conversations. You want to breathe life into any place your party adventures into, even if it's an abandoned vampire's castle.<br>
                    Another thing to add is an adventure! The players are interacting with the world, but without something driving them forward, a campaign can feel slow and boring at times. A way to fix this is to add things that your players can focus on. Be it a dragon attacking local towns, or a blacksmith that needs materials to make something, you can give your players quests to have a specific path for your adventure.

                <p>
                    When you DM, you've given yourself the role of a leader of the group, of sorts. It's your job to make sure every player at the table is having fun, and to do that, the players have to be involved in what you do.<br>
                    One way to make sure your players are involved is to work with them when they make their character's backstory. Having your players' backstories can give you fuel for your adventures, as you can add parts of their pasts to questlines, making them feel more involved in what's happening in your world.<br>
                    Another way to make sure they're involved is to ask them what they want from your adventure. If they don't care about roleplaying, you can have more combat-heavy sessions, and vice-versa. Even the theme of the campaign can be influenced by them: A group that likes comedy might not like a horror campaign.
