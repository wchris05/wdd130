      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Purpose Section:</b> The main purpose of the home page is to give some basic information about the other pages, as it's more of a hub for the information than an informational page. The page will give basic information and teach about what the other pages will give; Subpage 1 being information for how to play D&D as a player, and Subpage 2 being information about playing as a DM.<br>
        <b>Players Section:</b> Paragraph 1 will talk about the basics of Subpage 1, giving the key points of being a player; learning how to create a character, play the game, interact with the world, and interact with other players.<br>
        <b>DM Section:</b> Paragraph 2 will talk about the basics of Subpage 2, giving the key points of being the DM; learning how to create a world, add to the world (with people, lore, etc.), and work with the players.<br>

      </ul>
      <h3>Players</h3>
      <p>
        <b>The "Players" page will have four sections</b>, one for each of the previously stated key notes of being a player.<br>
        <b>Section 1 will talk about how to create a character</b>, seperating into four different aspects of it; Finding race/species and class, rolling for stats, giving personality and story, and selecting gear. The image for Section 1 will be an image of a D&amp;D character sheet.<br>
        <b>Section 2 will talk about how to play the game</b>, and will lead into Section 3 and 4 by introducing Combat as the main point, and giving a bit of information on Roleplaying.<br>
        <b>Section 3 and 4 will cover the two different parts of roleplaying in D&D</b>, with Section 3 showing off how you can use your character's skills to interact with Non-player characters and the environment, and section 4 elaborating on playing as your character and roleplaying with other members of the group.<br>

      <h3>Dungeon Masters</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Subpage 2 will have three sections</b>, one for each of the previously stated key points of being the DM.<br>
        <b>Section 1 will talk about worldbuilding</b>, and how you can either use a pre-made world, and build off of it through the players, or build a world of your own, which takes a lot more effort but can be more rewarding.<br>
        <b>Section 2 will talk about adding to the world</b> by creating NPCs (also known as Non-Player characters) that players can interact with and making secrets for the players to discover or work with you to create.<br>
        <b>Section 3 will talk about working with the players</b>, highlighting the importance of allowing players to have some say in what happens and telling why that's the case. It will then move on to some examples of ways you can work with the players, and will note that the examples aren't the only ways, and that the sky is the limit.<br>
